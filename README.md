#  Fine-Tuning-BERT-for-Multi-Class-Text-Classification

 **BERT-Based News Topic Classifier** -Classify news headlines into one of four categories - **World**, **Sports**, **Business**, or **Sci/Tech** - using a fine-tuned BERT transformer.

---

## Project Overview

This project uses **Hugging Face Transformers** and the **AG News** dataset to build a **text classification model**. It leverages the power of **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for understanding the context of short news headlines and predicting their correct category.

## How It Works 

**For Example** - Think of BERT as a multilingual, highly educated assistant you just hired.

Butâ€¦

BERT comes with general knowledge (pretrained on all kinds of books, Wikipedia, etc.), not specific expertise like recognizing news topics.

So you did this:

ðŸ§  Pretrained Knowledge (BERT)
âž¤ You hired a well-educated assistant with general English skills.

ðŸ“š Fine-Tuning (AG News)
âž¤ You gave them a special training course on how to read news headlines and classify them into one of 4 topics (Business, Sports, etc.).

ðŸŽ¯ Prediction (Sample News)
âž¤ Now, when you give them a new headline like:

"NASA launches a new satellite to Mars."
They confidently answer:
"That's Sci/Tech."
